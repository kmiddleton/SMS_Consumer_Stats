## Why am I talking about statistics today?

---

## Statistics in your daily life

> "For what is improbable does happen, and therefore it is probable
that improbable things will happen. Granted this, one might argue
that 'what is improbable is probable'. But this is not true
absolutely." (Aristotle, *Rhetoric*)

.center[
**Probable vs. improbable events**
]

---

## Statistics impacts you

1. Apply for a mortgage, car loan, or credit card
2. Take any medicine

---

## Common internet searches:

- chance of pregnancy on pill
- how to improve chance of getting pregnant
- chance of getting pregnant at age 41
- chance of getting pregnant while breastfeeding
- can you increase your chance of having a girl
- if twins run in my family what's my chance of having them?
- chance of siblings both having autism 

---

## Common internet searches:

- probability of  flopping a set with pocket pair in poker 
- chance of surviving severe head injury 
- chance of snow in Austin Texas 
- is there chance of flood in Saint Charles, Illinois today? 
- calculate my chance of getting to university of washington
- what are the chance of becoming a golf professional

---

## Common internet searches:

- probability of having an adverse reaction to amoxicillin
- does hypothyroid in women increase chance of liver cancer?
- does progesterone increase chance of breast cancer
- which treatment has the least chance of prostate cancer recurring?
- what is the chance of relapse in a low risk acute lymphoblastic lukemia patient
- chance of getting a brain tumor 

---

## Decisions, not statistics

### Making decisions based on data

- how much to exercise
- what to eat or not to eat
- how to travel

--

### How to live your life.

1. One movie earned $100 million in the first weekend
2. The other movie earned $1 million in the first weekend

---

## We are pretty bad at thinking about probabilities

We should be considering how probable events are.

1. Get the flu
2. Win Powerball lottery
3. Death by plane crash
4. Death by lightning or by venomous snake

---

## Base rates

Probabilities *unconditioned* on any other information

1. Pr[*Left Handed*] $\approx$ 1 / 10
2. Pr[*Death by Lightning*] $\approx$ 5 / 500,000
3. Pr[*Death by Venomous Snake*] $\approx$ 1 / 500,000

## "Pills kill"

- 1 in 8 may have completely stopped taking pills
- Others switched mid-cycle

The results:

- 26,000 more babies in England and Wales the next year
- £21 million for maternity care and £46 million for abortion provision
- Lives saved: "maybe one"

## "Pills kill"

- Base rate of thrombosis on "old" pills: 1 / 7000
- Rate of thrombosis on "new" pills: 2 / 7000

## Competing factors

- Scientists want to learn about the world
- Scientists & funding agencies want to have their research published
- Scientific journals and universities want to gain publicity
- Governments want to protect their citizens (FDA, CDC, etc.)
- Media want to make money from advertisements

.pull-right[
"Figures obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act found the number of prescriptions for the most common group of antidepressants rose by 43 per cent during the period covering the banking crisis and housing crash."

## Causation

Usually we are interested in causation.

- Two variables can have a significant association without any *direct* causal basis.
- Life expectancy vs. Per capita televisions

--

**Confounding variables** probably underlie the correlation (overall wealth).

- This is one of the main limitations of observational studies.

## "Alcohol May Set Off Allergies"

**Methods**

- 5870 Danish women ages 20-29
- No allergic rhinitis (AR) at baseline
- Self-reported behaviors and symptoms for ~8 years
- Controlled for age, smoking, education, follow-up time, passive smoking in childhood and, parental asthma

.footnote[
Bendtsen et al. (2007) *Clin Exp Allergy* 38: 1179-1185.
]

---

## "Alcohol May Set Off Allergies"

**Results**

- 831 develop seasonal AR
- 523 develop perennial AR
- "Alcohol consumption was positively associated with the risk of developing perennial AR ... among women drinking more than 14 drinks/week compared with women drinking <1 drink/week" (Odds Ratio = 1.78)

---

## The scourge of odds ratios

$$OR = \frac{\text{Probability of developing AR}}{\text{Probability of not developing AR}}$$

- Probabilities range from $0 \rightarrow 1$
- Odds ratios range from $0 \rightarrow \infty$

---

## What is the base rate?

523 out of 5870 develop perennial AR

--

$$\frac{523}{5870} = 9\%$$

--

Of that 9% who develop perennial AR:

- the comparison of >14 drinks per week relative to <1 drink per week $\rightarrow$ 78% greater probability

---

## Beware of confounding variables

Histamines can cause allergies and allergy-related symptoms

– Lots of foods contain or release histamines.

--

**Cuisine of Denmark**

> Hot meals are traditionally prepared from ground meats, such as frikadeller (meat balls) and medisterpølse (spiced sausage), or from more substantial meat and fish dishes such as flæskesteg (roast pork with crackling) or kogt torsk (poached cod) with mustard sauce and trimmings.

---

## Histamine-Rich Foods

*Alcoholic beverages, especially beer and wine*; Anchovies; Avocados; Cheeses, especially aged or fermented cheese, such as Parmesan, blue and Roquefort; Cider; Dried fruits such as apricots, dates, prunes, figs and raisins; Eggplant; Fermented foods, such as pickled or smoked meats, sauerkraut, etc.; Mackerel; Mushrooms; Processed meats - sausage, salami, etc.; Sardines; Smoked fish - herring, sardines, etc.; Sour cream, sour milk, buttermilk, yogurt; Soured breads, such as pumpernickel, other foods made with large amounts of yeast.; Spinach; Tomatoes; Vinegar or vinegar-containing foods, such as mayonnaise, salad dressing, ketchup, chili sauce, pickles, pickled beets, relishes, olives

## Alcohol Worsens Allergies?

- Only >14 drinks compared to <1 drink is "significant"
- Only 32 / 523 (6%) were in this group

1. Real effect, opposite direction
2. Real effect, smaller magnitude
3. No effect despite having previously found one

## ASA statement on P-values (2016)

- P-values *can* indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model.
- P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.
- Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a P-value passes a specific threshold.
- A P-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result.

## Being a good consumer

- Be skeptical
- Think about the source(s)
- Dig deep
- Think about the base rate
