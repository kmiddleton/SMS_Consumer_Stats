## Why am I talking about statistics today?

---

## Statistics in your daily life

> "For what is improbable does happen, and therefore it is probable
that improbable things will happen. Granted this, one might argue
that 'what is improbable is probable'. But this is not true
absolutely." (Aristotle, *Rhetoric*)

Probable vs. improbable events

---

## Statistics impacts you

Example

Example

---

## Common internet searches involving probability (David Aldous):

- chance of pregnancy on pill
- how to improve chance of getting pregnant
- chance of getting pregnant at age 41
- chance of getting pregnant while breastfeeding
- can you increase your chance of having a girl
- if twins run in my family what's my chance of having them?
- chance of siblings both having autism 

---

## Common internet searches involving probability (David Aldous):

- probability of  flopping a set with pocket pair in poker 
- chance of surviving severe head injury 
- chance of snow in Austin Texas 
- is there chance of flood in Saint Charles, Illinois today? 
- calculate my chance of getting to university of washington
- what are the chance of becoming a golf professional

---

## Common internet searches involving probability (David Aldous):

- probability of having an adverse reaction to amoxicillin
- does hypothyroid in women increase chance of liver cancer?
- does progesterone increase chance of breast cancer
- which treatment has the least chance of prostate cancer recurring?
- what is the chance of relapse in a low risk acute lymphoblastic lukemia patient
- chance of getting a brain tumor

# Inference, not statistics

## Making decisions based on data

- how to travel
- how much to exercise
- what to eat

---

## We're pretty good at informal inference

---

## Example 1

---

## Example 2

---

## We are pretty bad at thinking about probabilities

We should be considering how probable are certain events.

1. Get the flu
2. Win Powerball lottery
3. Death by plane crash

---

## History of probability

---

## UK birth control example

---

## Thinking about the base rate

---

## Being a skeptical statistical consumer

Factors at odds with each other:

1. Scientists & grant funding agencies want to have their research published
2. Scientific journals and unversities want to gain publicity
3. Government wants to protect its citizens (FDA, CDC, etc.)
4. Newspapers want to make money
5. *You* want to make decisions that impact your life

---

## Thinking critically about what you read

https://www.livescience.com/3780-odds-dying.html

---

## Every statistical story has context

---

## Association $\neq$ causation

.pull-right[
"Figures obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act found the number of prescriptions for the most common group of antidepressants rose by 43 per cent during the period covering the banking crisis and housing crash."
]

## Correlation vs. Causation

Usually we are interested in causation.

- But two variables can have a significant association without any *direct* causal basis.
    - Life expectancy vs. Per capita televisions
    - Chocolate consumption and electricty usage in Australia 1950-2000

Confounding variables (overall wealth) probably underlie the correlation.

- This is one of the main limitations of observational studies.

## "Alcohol May Set Off Allergies"

## "Alcohol May Set Off Allergies"

Bendtsen et al. (2007) Alcohol consumption and the risk of self-reported perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis in young adult women in a population-based cohort study. *Clin Exp Allergy* 38: 1179-1185.

METHODS: Five thousand eight hundred and seventy Danish women aged 20-29 years participated in a prospective cohort study, and were free of seasonal and perennial AR at baseline (1991-1993). Alcohol consumption was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. The main outcome measures were self-reported information on seasonal and perennial AR debuting during a mean follow-up period of 7.8 years.

---

## "Alcohol May Set Off Allergies"

RESULTS: During follow-up, 831 women developed seasonal AR and 523 women developed perennial AR, corresponding to 14% and 9%. Alcohol consumption was positively associated with the risk of developing perennial AR. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for perennial AR was 1.78 (95% CI, 1.13-2.80) among women drinking more than 14 drinks/week compared with women drinking <1 drink/week.

## "Alcohol May Set Off Allergies"

Beware of confounding variables.

Histamines can cause allergies and allergy-related symptoms

â€“ Lots of foods contain or release histamines.

Both studies were among northern European populations of women.

# "Alcohol Worsens Allergies"

Histamine-Rich Foods:

> *Alcoholic beverages, especially beer and wine*; Anchovies; Avocados; Cheeses, especially aged or fermented cheese, such as parmesan, blue and Roquefort; Cider and home-made root beer; Dried fruits such as apricots, dates, prunes, figs and raisins; Eggplant; Fermented foods, such as pickled or smoked meats, sauerkraut, etc.; Mackerel; Mushrooms; Processed meats - sausage, hot dogs, salami, etc.; Sardines; Smoked fish - herring, sardines, etc.; Sour cream, sour milk, buttermilk, yogurt - especially if not fresh; Soured breads, such as pumpernickel, coffee cakes and other foods made with large amounts of yeast.; Spinach; Tomatoes; Vinegar or vinegar-containing foods, such as mayonnaise, salad dressing, ketchup, chili sauce, pickles, pickled beets, relishes, olives; Yogurt 

Histamine-Releasing Foods:

> Alcohol; Bananas; Chocolate; Eggs; Fish; Milk; Papayas; Pineapple; Shellfish; Strawberries; Tomatoes

## Abraham de Moivre: In praise of gambling

What is the probability of getting dealt 4 aces in a poker hand?

$$\frac{4}{52}\frac{3}{51}\frac{2}{50}\frac{1}{49}\frac{48}{48}\times 5 = 0.000018 = 0.0018\%$$

(There is nothing special about aces.)

## Inverse probability

> Given that a poker player has dealt three hands in a row with four aces, *what is the probability that the deck is loaded*?

# Thomas Bayes

---

# Pierre Simon Laplace

1774

---

# A little math

$$P(a,b) = P(a|b)P(b)$$

$$P(a,b) = P(b|a)P(a)$$

$$P(b|a) = \frac{P(a|b)P(b)}{P(a)}$$
---

## For scientific inference

$$P(b|a) = \frac{P(a|b)P(b)}{P(a)}$$

$$P(hypothesis|data) = \frac{P(data|hypothesis)P(hypothesis)}{P(data)}$$

$$P(hypothesis|data) = \frac{P(data|hypothesis)P(hypothesis)}{\Sigma_{h'\in H}P(d'|h')P(h')}$$

Posterior probability is the product of the likelihood and prior normalized by their sum (to make the probability sum to 1).

---

## Rolling dice

$$P(a,b) = P(a|b)P(b)$$

$$P(roll~1, roll~1) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$$

## Bayesian clinical reasoning

**Data**: Your patient has a cough

**Hypotheses**:

--

1. Patient has a cold

--

2. Patient has lung cancer

--

3. Patient has gastroenteritis

---

# Priors

Some reasonable priors:

--

1. Cold (lifetime risk ~100%)

--

2. Lung cancer (lifetime risk ~6%)

--

3. Gastroenteritis (lifetime risk ~100%)


---

# Posterior

1. High prior X high likelihood = most probable

--

2. Low prior X low likelihood = low probability

--

3. High prior Xlow likelihood = low probability
