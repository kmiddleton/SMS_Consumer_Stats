## Why am I talking about statistics today?

---

# Statistics in your daily life

> "For what is improbable does happen, and therefore it is probable
that improbable things will happen. Granted this, one might argue
that 'what is improbable is probable'. But this is not true absolutely." (Aristotle, *Rhetoric*)

- chance of getting pregnant while breastfeeding
- can you increase your chance of having a girl
- if twins run in my family what's my chance of having them?
- chance of siblings both having autism

# Inference, not statistics

## Making decisions based on data

- how to travel
- how much to exercise
- what to eat

# We're pretty good at informal inference
