## Why am I talking about statistics today?

---

## Statistics in your daily life

&gt; "For what is improbable does happen, and therefore it is probable
that improbable things will happen. Granted this, one might argue
that 'what is improbable is probable'. But this is not true
absolutely." (Aristotle, *Rhetoric*)

.center[
**Probable vs. improbable events**
]

---

## Statistics impacts you

Example

Example

---

## Common internet searches:

- chance of pregnancy on pill
- how to improve chance of getting pregnant
- chance of getting pregnant at age 41
- chance of getting pregnant while breastfeeding
- can you increase your chance of having a girl
- if twins run in my family what's my chance of having them?
- chance of siblings both having autism 

---

## Common internet searches:

- probability of  flopping a set with pocket pair in poker 
- chance of surviving severe head injury 
- chance of snow in Austin Texas 
- is there chance of flood in Saint Charles, Illinois today? 
- calculate my chance of getting to university of washington
- what are the chance of becoming a golf professional

---

## Common internet searches:

- probability of having an adverse reaction to amoxicillin
- does hypothyroid in women increase chance of liver cancer?
- does progesterone increase chance of breast cancer
- which treatment has the least chance of prostate cancer recurring?
- what is the chance of relapse in a low risk acute lymphoblastic lukemia patient
- chance of getting a brain tumor 

---

# Inference, not statistics

## Making decisions based on data

- how to travel
- how much to exercise
- what to eat

---

## We're pretty good at informal inference

---

## Example 1

---

## Example 2

---

## We are pretty bad at thinking about probabilities

We should be considering how probable are certain events.

1. Get the flu
2. Win Powerball lottery
3. Death by plane crash
4. Being strangled by your bedsheets

---

## We are pretty bad at thinking about probabilities

Which is more probable?

1. Jane is a biologist
2. Jane is a biologist and is right handed

---

## History of probability

---

## UK birth control example

---

## Thinking about the base rate

---

## Competing factors

1. Scientists &amp; grant funding agencies want to have their research published
2. Scientific journals and unversities want to gain publicity
3. Government wants to protect its citizens (FDA, CDC, etc.)
4. Newspapers want to make money
5. *You* want to make decisions that impact your life

---

## Thinking critically about what you read

### Every statistical story has context

"Figures obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act found the number of prescriptions for the most common group of antidepressants rose by 43 per cent during the period covering the banking crisis and housing crash."
]

---

## Causation

Usually we are interested in causation.

- Two variables can have a significant association without any *direct* causal basis.
- Life expectancy vs. Per capita televisions

--

**Confounding variables** (overall wealth) probably underlie the correlation.

- This is one of the main limitations of observational studies.

## "Alcohol May Set Off Allergies"

![:scale 100%](https://i.imgur.com/ZXtZHOz.png)

---

## "Alcohol May Set Off Allergies"

**Methods**

- 5870 Danish women ages 20-29
- No allergic rhinitis (AR) at baseline
- Self-reported behaviors and symptoms for ~8 years
- Controlled for age, smoking, education, follow-up time, passive smoking in childhood and, parental asthma

.footnote[
Bendtsen et al. (2007) *Clin Exp Allergy* 38: 1179-1185.
]

---

## "Alcohol May Set Off Allergies"

**Results**

- 831 develop seasonal AR
- 523 develop perennial AR
- "Alcohol consumption was positively associated with the risk of developing perennial AR ... among women drinking more than 14 drinks/week compared with women drinking &lt;1 drink/week" (Odds Ratio = 1.78)

---

## The scourge of odds ratios

`$$OR = \frac{\text{Probability of developing AR}}{\text{Probability of not developing AR}}$$`

- Probabilities range from `\(0 \rightarrow 1\)`
- Odds ratios range from `\(0 \rightarrow \infty\)`

---

## What is the base rate?

523 out of 5870 develop perennial AR

--

`$$\frac{523}{5870} = 9\%$$`

--

Of that 9% who develop perennial AR:

- the comparison of &gt;14 drinks per week relative to &lt;1 drink per week `\(\rightarrow\)` 78% greater probability

---

## Beware of confounding variables

Histamines can cause allergies and allergy-related symptoms

– Lots of foods contain or release histamines.

--

**Cuisine of Denmark**

&gt; Hot meals are traditionally prepared from ground meats, such as frikadeller (meat balls) and medisterpølse (spiced sausage), or from more substantial meat and fish dishes such as flæskesteg (roast pork with crackling) or kogt torsk (poached cod) with mustard sauce and trimmings.

---

## Histamine-Rich Foods

*Alcoholic beverages, especially beer and wine*; Anchovies; Avocados; Cheeses, especially aged or fermented cheese, such as parmesan, blue and Roquefort; Cider; Dried fruits such as apricots, dates, prunes, figs and raisins; Eggplant; Fermented foods, such as pickled or smoked meats, sauerkraut, etc.; Mackerel; Mushrooms; Processed meats - sausage, salami, etc.; Sardines; Smoked fish - herring, sardines, etc.; Sour cream, sour milk, buttermilk, yogurt; Soured breads, such as pumpernickel, other foods made with large amounts of yeast.; Spinach; Tomatoes; Vinegar or vinegar-containing foods, such as mayonnaise, salad dressing, ketchup, chili sauce, pickles, pickled beets, relishes, olives

---

## Alcohol Worsens Allergies?

![](https://i.imgur.com/fAqxsVI.png)

- Only &gt;14 drinks compared to &lt;1 drink is "significant"
- Only 32 / 523 (6%) were in this group

## Is most published research false?

1. Garden of forking paths
2. Researcher publication bias
3. Journal publication bias
4. **Science-wide** error rate

---

## (Non)Reproducibility

1. Real effect, opposite direction
2. Real effect, smaller magnitude
3. No effect despite having previously found one

Usually we think of the inability to reproduce an experiment as resulting from poor experimental design or errors in data collection.

# A little math

`$$P(a,b) = P(a|b)P(b)$$`

`$$P(a,b) = P(b|a)P(a)$$`

`$$P(b|a) = \frac{P(a|b)P(b)}{P(a)}$$`
---

## For scientific inference

`$$P(b|a) = \frac{P(a|b)P(b)}{P(a)}$$`

`$$P(hypothesis|data) = \frac{P(data|hypo)P(hypo)}{P(data)}$$`

`$$P(hypothesis|data) = \frac{P(data|hypo)P(hypo)}{\Sigma_{h'\in H}P(d'|h')P(h')}$$`

Posterior probability is the product of the likelihood and prior normalized by their sum (to make the probability sum to 1).

---

## Rolling dice

`$$P(a,b) = P(a|b)P(b)$$`

`$$P(roll~1, roll~1) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$$`

## Bayesian clinical reasoning

**Data**: Your patient has a cough

**Hypotheses**:

--

1. Patient has a cold

--

2. Patient has lung cancer

--

3. Patient has gastroenteritis

---

# Priors

Some reasonable priors:

--

1. Cold (lifetime risk ~99%)

--

2. Lung cancer (lifetime risk ~6%)

--

3. Gastroenteritis (lifetime risk ~99%)


---

# Posterior

1. High prior x high likelihood = high posterior probability

--

2. Low prior x low likelihood = low posterior probability

--

3. High prior x low likelihood = low posterior probability
