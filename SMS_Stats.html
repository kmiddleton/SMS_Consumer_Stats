## Why am I talking about statistics today?

---

# Statistics in your daily life

&gt; "For what is improbable does happen, and therefore it is probable
that improbable things will happen. Granted this, one might argue
that 'what is improbable is probable'. But this is not true absolutely." (Aristotle, *Rhetoric*)

# Common internet searches involving probability (David Aldous):

- chance of pregnancy on pill
- how to improve chance of getting pregnant
- chance of getting pregnant at age 41
- chance of getting pregnant while breastfeeding
- can you increase your chance of having a girl
- if twins run in my family what's my chance of having them?
- chance of siblings both having autism

- probability of  flopping a set with pocket pair in poker 
- chance of surviving severe head injury 
- chance of snow in Austin Texas 
- is there chance of flood in Saint Charles, Illinois today? 
- calculate my chance of getting to university of washington
- what are the chance of becoming a golf professional

- probability of having an adverse reaction to amoxicillin
- does hypothyroid in women increase chance of liver cancer?
- does progesterone increase chance of breast cancer
- which treatment has the least chance of prostate cancer recurring?
- what is the chance of relapse in a low risk acute lymphoblastic lukemia patient
- chance of getting a brain tumor

# Inference, not statistics

## Making decisions based on data

- how to travel
- how much to exercise
- what to eat

---

# We're pretty good at informal inference

# Example 1

# Example 2

---

# We are pretty bad at thinking about probabilities
