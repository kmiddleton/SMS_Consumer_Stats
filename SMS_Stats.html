## Why am I talking about statistics today?

---

## Probability in your daily life

&gt; "For what is improbable does happen, and therefore it is probable
that improbable things will happen. Granted this, one might argue
that 'what is improbable is probable'. But this is not true
absolutely." (Aristotle, *Rhetoric*)

**Probable vs. improbable events**

## Probability impacts you

1. Apply for a mortgage, car loan, or credit card
1. Buy life insurance
1. Go to the doctor
1. Take any medicine
1. Go in a building, drive across a bridge

## Decisions, not statistics

### Making decisions based on data

- how much to exercise
- what to eat or not to eat
- how to travel
- take that medicine or not
- have surgery or not

--

### How to live your life.

## Evacuate or not?

1. One movie earned $100 million in the first weekend
2. The other movie earned $1 million in the first weekend

---

## We are pretty bad at thinking about probabilities

We should be considering how probable events are.

1. Get the flu
2. Win Powerball lottery
3. Death by plane crash
5. Death by lightning or by venomous snake

---

## Base rates

Probabilities *unconditioned* on any other information

1. Pr[*Get the flu*] `\(\approx\)` 1
2. Pr[*Win Powerball lottery*] = 1 / 292,201,338
3. Pr[*Death by Lightning*] `\(\approx\)` 5 / 500,000
5. Pr[*Death by Venomous Snake*] `\(\approx\)` 1 / 500,000

Some will never change. Some will.

## Dear Doctor...

&gt; "New evidence has become available indicating that the chance of thrombosis occurring in a vein is increased around **two-fold** for some types of [birth control] pill compared to others." (UK Committee of Safety of Medicines, 1995)

## "Pills kill"

- 1 in 8 may have completely stopped taking pills
- Others switched mid-cycle

## "Pills kill"

- 1 in 8 may have completely stopped taking pills
- Others switched mid-cycle

The results:

- 26,000 more babies in England and Wales the next year
- £21 million for maternity care and £46 million for abortion provision
- Lives saved: "maybe one"

---

## "Pills kill"

Base rate of thrombosis on "old" pills:
$$
1 / 7000

Rate of thrombosis on "new" pills:

$$
2 / 7000

## Where does this disconnect come from?

---

## Competing factors

- Scientists want to learn about the world
- Scientists and funding agencies want to have their research published
- Scientific journals and universities want to gain publicity
- Governments want to protect their citizens (FDA, CDC, etc.)
- Media want to make money from advertisements

## Think critically

### Every statistical story has context

"Figures obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act found the number of prescriptions for the most common group of antidepressants rose by 43 per cent during the period covering the banking crisis and housing crash."
]

---

## Correlation `\(\neq\)` Causation

Usually we are interested in causation.

- Two variables can have a significant association without any *direct* causal basis.
- Life expectancy vs. Per capita televisions

--

**Confounding variables** probably underlie the correlation (overall wealth).

- This is one of the main limitations of observational studies.

## "Alcohol May Set Off Allergies"

**Methods**

- 5870 Danish women ages 20-29
- No allergic rhinitis (AR) at baseline
- Self-reported behaviors and symptoms for ~8 years
- Controlled for age, smoking, education, follow-up time, passive smoking in childhood and, parental asthma

.footnote[
Bendtsen et al. (2007) *Clin Exp Allergy* 38: 1179-1185.
]

---

## "Alcohol May Set Off Allergies"

**Results**

- 831 develop seasonal AR
- 523 develop perennial AR
- "Alcohol consumption was positively associated with the risk of developing perennial AR ... among women drinking more than 14 drinks/week compared with women drinking &lt;1 drink/week" (Odds Ratio = 1.78)

---

## The scourge of odds ratios

`$$OR = \frac{\text{Probability of developing AR}}{\text{Probability of not developing AR}}$$`

- Probabilities range from `\(0 \rightarrow 1\)`
- Odds ratios range from `\(0 \rightarrow \infty\)`

---

## What is the base rate?

523 out of 5870 develop perennial AR

--

`$$\frac{523}{5870} = 9\%$$`

--

Of that 9% who develop perennial AR:

- the comparison of &gt;14 drinks per week relative to &lt;1 drink per week `\(\rightarrow\)` 78% greater probability

---

## Beware of confounding variables

Histamines can cause allergies and allergy-related symptoms

– Lots of foods contain or release histamines.

--

**Cuisine of Denmark**

&gt; Hot meals are traditionally prepared from ground meats, such as frikadeller (meat balls) and medisterpølse (spiced sausage), or from more substantial meat and fish dishes such as flæskesteg (roast pork with crackling) or kogt torsk (poached cod) with mustard sauce and trimmings.

---

## Histamine-Rich Foods

*Alcoholic beverages, especially beer and wine*; Anchovies; Avocados; Cheeses, especially aged or fermented cheese, such as Parmesan, blue and Roquefort; Cider; Dried fruits such as apricots, dates, prunes, figs and raisins; Eggplant; Fermented foods, such as pickled or smoked meats, sauerkraut, etc.; Mackerel; Mushrooms; Processed meats - sausage, salami, etc.; Sardines; Smoked fish - herring, sardines, etc.; Sour cream, sour milk, buttermilk, yogurt; Soured breads, such as pumpernickel, other foods made with large amounts of yeast.; Spinach; Tomatoes; Vinegar or vinegar-containing foods, such as mayonnaise, salad dressing, ketchup, chili sauce, pickles, pickled beets, relishes, olives

---

## Alcohol Worsens Allergies?

![](https://i.imgur.com/fAqxsVI.png)

- Only &gt;14 drinks compared to &lt;1 drink is "significant"
- Only 32 / 523 (6%) were in this group

Smoking 15 or more cigarettes a day reduces the likelihood of seasonal AR.

## Is most published research false?

![:scale 100%](https://i.imgur.com/EC262ia.png)


- "Statistically significant" results are more likely to be published.
- Not all these results can be "true positives".

---

## P-values and the peril of null hypothesis testing

&gt; What is the probability of observing these results if the null hypothesis were true?

- Null hypothesis is a straw-man.
    - We don't do science thinking there is no effect.

## Is most published research false?

1. Garden of forking paths
2. Researcher publication bias
3. Journal publication bias
4. **Science-wide** error rate

---

## (Non-)Reproducibility

1. Real effect, opposite direction
2. Real effect, smaller magnitude
3. No effect despite having previously found one

Usually we think of the inability to reproduce an experiment as resulting from poor experimental design or errors in data collection.

## ASA statement on P-values (2016)

- P-values *can* indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model.
- P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.
- Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a P-value passes a specific threshold.
- A P-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result.

---

## Being a good consumer

- Be skeptical
- Think about the source(s)
- Dig deep
- Think about the base rate
